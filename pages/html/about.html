                <h3 class="card-title">Mission</h3>
                <p class="card-description">
                    My mission is singular, to wake up the 12 Tribes of Israel. I am dedicated to helping wake up the 144,000 elect men from the lost 12 tribes of Israel, also known as the Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans.

            <!-- Beliefs Card -->
            <section class="about-card">
                <h3 class="card-title">Beliefs</h3>
                <p class="card-description">
                    So-called <strong>Blacks</strong>, <strong>Latinos/Hispanics</strong>, and <strong>Native Americans</strong> of <strong>negro</strong> and <strong>indigenous patrilineal descent</strong> are the Children of Israel according to <strong>History</strong>, <strong>Archaeology</strong>, and most importantly, <strong>BIBLICAL PROPHECY</strong>. It is through the understanding of this identity that we reconnect with our divine heritage and the promises made by our Heavenly Father, <strong>YHWH</strong>. The <strong>promise of salvation</strong> and the inheritance of the Kingdom of God is for <strong>Israel</strong> alone, as it is written in <strong>Psalm 147:19-20</strong>: *"He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel. He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his judgments, they have not known them."*

                    Our calling is to wake up the <strong>ELECT</strong> of Israel and bring them to repentance and salvation through <strong>HaMashiach YHWHshai</strong>, the only way to the Father. May all Israelites recognize their true identity and return to the commandments of <strong>YHWH</strong>, for only then will we receive the full inheritance of the Kingdom promised to us.
